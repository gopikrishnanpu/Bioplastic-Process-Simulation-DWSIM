# Bioplastic-Process-Simulation-DWSIM
Process simulation and scale-up for starch-based bioplastic synthesis using DWSIM.
This repository contains the DWSIM simulation for the industrial scale-up of my research project, "Biogreen Fusion". The project focuses on the formulation of biodegradable plastics using agro-waste from Musa paradisiaca (Banana), Carica papaya, and Manihot esculenta (Tapioca) leaves.
This research was recognized and funded by the Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST).

Process Flow Diagram (PFD)The simulation models a four-stage production line
Mixing (MIX-01): Blending biomass feedstocks with chemical additives.
Heating (HT-01): Thermal gelatinization to facilitate polymer synthesis.
Separation (CS-01): Removal of waste-water streams from the polymer matrix.
Drying (DR-01): Final moisture removal to achieve the desired product density.
