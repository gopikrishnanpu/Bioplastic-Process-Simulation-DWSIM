# Bioplastic-Process-Simulation-DWSIM
Process simulation and scale-up for starch-based bioplastic synthesis using DWSIM.


This repository contains the DWSIM simulation for the industrial scale-up of my research project, **"Biogreen Fusion."** The project focuses on the formulation of biodegradable plastics using agro-waste from *Musa paradisiaca* (Banana), *Carica papaya*, and *Manihot esculenta* (Tapioca) leaves. This research was recognized and funded by the **Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology (TNSCST)**.

## Technical Specifications
* **Software:** DWSIM (CAPE-OPEN compliant)
* **Thermodynamic Model:** NRTL / Steam Tables
* **Key Components:** Starch-based biomass, Glycerol (Plasticizer), and Acetic Acid

## Simulation Results
Based on the steady-state simulation, the following parameters were established:
* **Bioplastic Yield:** 1.94 kg/s
* **Product Density:** 71.66 kg/m³
* **Dryer Energy Load (DR-01):** 665.69 kW
* **Mixture Molecular Weight:** 72.51 kg/kmol

## Process Flow Diagram (PFD)
The simulation models a four-stage production line:
1. **Mixing (MIX-01):** Blending biomass feedstocks with chemical additives.
2. **Heating (HT-01):** Thermal gelatinization to facilitate polymer synthesis.
3. **Separation (CS-01):** Removal of waste-water streams from the polymer matrix.
4. **Drying (DR-01):** Final moisture removal to achieve the desired product density.
